        <h3>Song's Genre Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With the developing technology, a transition to the digital
world is observed in many sectors. The music industry is one
of them. Spotify is one of the leading names in the digital
music markets. Established in 2006, Spotify has been one of
the most used music applications of recent times. This
platform, which contains thousands of songs and playlists
suitable for every style, every fashion, every moment, allows
users to easily access the music they want with personalized
recommendations.
 This project aims to predict the type of songs in Spotify
by their characteristics. The purpose of this is to increase the
speed of reaching the right audience by predicting the genre
of a new music.
 For these purposes, the data set used in the project was
examined in detail. By applying data preprocessing steps, the
data has been brought into a usable form in machine learning
algorithms. Then, accuracy calculations were made by
choosing the most suitable algorithms for the content of the
data. The algorithm model that gave the most reliable result
was selected.

    <h5> Dataset Information </h5>
    <p>In the study, a data set containing the features of the songs
in Spotify was used. In the data set, which contains 42305
rows and 22 different variables, 11 of them are float64, 3 of
them are int64 and 8 of them are object. This data set contains
1 categorical type target column. The target column contains
the genre of songs.</p>
   <p>The aim of the study is to create a model that predicts the
type of song according to the characteristics of the songs with
machine learning algorithms. Before the model was created,
a preliminary study was carried out on the data set containing
categorically and numerically different types of variables.
 First of all, the distribution of the target column and the
statistical values of the numerical data were examined in
order to get to know the data set more closely.</p>
    <p>There are quite large distribution
differences between the target values. This shows that under
sampling or oversampling should be done before modeling.
</p>
    <p>The standard deviation of the
variables named duration_ms and Unnamed: 0.1.1 is quite
high. This indicates that there are very large deviations in the
values of these variables.
 Visualizations were made based on the questions
extracted from the analyzed data set. Graphs where data such
as distribution, density, boxplot can be examined from
different perspectives are examined. The visualizations
helped us get more accurate information about some
variables. For this reason, it is a very important step to do
before data preprocessing.</p>
    <p>It was understood
that some of the variables that were evaluated numerically
were actually categorical.</p>
    <p>When the densities of the numeric values are examined, it is observed that the energy value firstly
shows a left-skewed intensity, while the duration_ms value is
right-skewed. However, there is an exponential density
distribution throughout the table.</p>
    <p> Boxplots are graphs that provide information about
outliers. For this reason, boxplots of all variables according
to types were examined. There are
outlier values in the data. Based on these graphics, it was
decided that outlier analysis should definitely be done. After getting to know and examining the data thoroughly,
the actions to be taken on it were determined and studies were
continued in this direction.
</p>
    <p>After all the processes were completed, modeling processes
were started with the data set, which has 80250 rows and 29
columns.
