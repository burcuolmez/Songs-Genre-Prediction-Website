            <h5>Used Technologies</h5>
            <br>
            <p> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language [1]</p>
            <p>Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data
science, machine learning applications, large-scale data
processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to
simplify package management and deployment.[2]</p>
            <p>Spyder is an open-source cross-platform integrated
development environment for scientific programming in
the Python language[3]</p>

            <h5>Used Libraries</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Pandas is a software library written for the Python
programming language for data manipulation
and analysis.[4]</p>
            <p>Numpy is a library for the Python programming
language, adding support for large, multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large
collection of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays.[5]</p>
            <p>Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python
programming language and its numerical mathematics
extension NumPy.[6]</p>
            <p>Missingno is a Python library that provides the ability
to understand the distribution of missing values through
informative visualizations. [7]</p>
            <p>Sklearn is a free software machine
learning library for the Python programming language.

            <h5>Data Preprocessing</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Firstly, the types of all columns in the data set were
examined and the object types were converted to
categorical types, because the python programming
language can perceive the object type as a string. If all
values in a feature are different or the same, these features
such as type, url, have been removed so that the model
can be generalized.
Then, missing values were determined by using
visualization techniques. There were features with few
missing values and one column with more than 50%
missing values. It was examined whether the reason for
the emptiness was random or not, and when it was
decided that it was random, the column was deleted. The
KNN imputer which is a machine learning technique, was
used to fill in other missing values. Imputation was
performed in a uniform way by looking at the 5 closest
neighbors. Before using KNN imputer, the data was
scaled.
The most commonly used method for outlier analysis is
the Interquartile range (IQR) calculation. However, a
feature-based outlier analysis is made with the created
boxplots. With the more advanced Local Outlier Factor
technique, outliers are detected within the context. Values
that are truly outliers are found. The parameters used for
this technique are that n_neighbors is 20 and
contamination is 0.1. After that, outliers were deleted
from the data set.
Since there are more numeric values in the dataset,
categorical variables are converted to dummy format.
Also duplicate lines were detected and deleted.
When the target column is examined, the multinominal
label values are unbalanced. For this reason, by using
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE),
all data has been increased by both copying and
synthesizing to reach the number of the tag that has
maximum number of instances. To use this technique,
Label Encoder was used on the target column beforehand. </p>
