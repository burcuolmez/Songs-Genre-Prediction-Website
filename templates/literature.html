            <h5>A. Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning Techniques Hareesh Bahuleyan</h5>
            <p>The project’s aim is which has been mentioned in this
article, about categorizing music files according to their
genre. Two significant approaches have been tested and
compared in this study. First one is deep learning approach
and the second approach is traditional machine learning
algorithms. The first model has been created with
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the model has
been trained end to end on the spectrogram of the audio
signal. In the second part, features and the time domain has
been extracted. Then, these features fed to CNN which are
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and
Support Vector Machine. In this study, Audio Set which is a
large-scale human annotated database of sounds has been
used. This dataset has been created vy extracting 10-second
sound clips from a total of 2.1 million YouTube videos. At
the preprocessing step, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
signal has been improved by pre-emphasis filter. Then deep
learning has been used, in according to this genre
classification can be done with no need of hand-created
features. CNN has been widely used in the field of image
classification. At this point, wave can be represented as a
spectrogram which can be considered as an image. So, the
spectrograms have been generated. Spectrograms have some
characteristic patterns by examining the spectrograms.
Convolution, pooling and non-linear activation operations
has been applied. To prevent overfitting L-2 Regularization
and Dropout strategies has been adopted. At the second part,
Time domain features are central moments which are mean,
standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the amplitude of
the signal, zero crossing rate, Root mean square energy,
tempo. Frequency domain features are Mel-Frequency
cepstral coefficients, Chroma features, Spectral centroid,
Spectral band-width, Spectral Contrast, Spectral Roll-off.
Logistic regression classifier implemented as one-vs-rest
method. As a result of the class which has the highest
probability chosen as predicted class. Random forest
classifier is an ensemble learner and uses bootstrap
aggregation and random subset of features. As a result of
predicted class has the majority vote from the individual
classifiers. Gradient Boosting Classifier is also an ensemble
learning algorithm which uses weak learners and
interestingly, classifier becomes really powerful. Support
Vector Machines classifier transforms the original input data
into high dimensional space y using kernel trick. In this study
radial basis function has been used. Accuracy, F-score and
AUC metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models.
The best performance in terms of all metrics is belong to the
CNN model which based on VCG-16 which used only the
spectrograms. And xtreme gradient boosting has really great
scores at feature engineering-based models. Then most
important features have been extracted from XGBoost model.</p>
            <h5>B. IRJET- Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms: A comparison</h5>
            <p>The model which is in the study aims to categorize the
music in terms of their genre. Free music archive dataset has
been used. Multiple classification model has been applied and
compared in according to their accuracy scores. Melspectrograms and spectrograms has been used. Companies
use music classification for better recommendation to their
customers. The dataset contains danceability, tempo, energy,
etc. columns. Balanced dataset has been used. Deep Neural
Networks provides the great results without using handcrafted features. CNN algorithm is a great choice for images
and the sound wave can be represented as a spectrogram
which can be considered as an image. Spectrograms has been
generated with the signals. Convolutional Neural Networks
and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks has been
used. And the parallel model which uses both of the
algorithms has been applied. To prevent overfitting Dropout
strategy has been adopted. This strategy sets some neurons
weight to zero randomly during training. So, every iteration
is different than the other. The dataset has been randomly
splitted into training set (80%), validation set (10%) and the
test set (%10). Time domain features and frequency domain
features has been extracted. Logistic Regression Classifier
implemented as a one-vs-rest method. The class with highest
probability is chosen as predicted class. Simple Artificial
Neural Networks is a computational model-based approach.
And also, it was appropriate for the complex nature of the
dataset. Accuracy metric has been used for the evaluation of
the model’s performance. CNN model has the best accuracy
in the spectrogram-based models. And Simple Artificial
Neural Network has the best accuracy in the feature-based
models. As a result, increasing the training dataset might
create the differences.</p>
